## How Skills Work

Skills follow a three-tier architecture:

1. **Metadata** - Name and activation criteria (always loaded)
2. **Instructions** - Core guidance (loaded when activated)  
3. **Resources** - Examples and templates (loaded on demand)

## Activation

Skills activate automatically when:

- You mention a skill by name
- Your request matches a skill's "Use when..." triggers
- An agent determines skill knowledge is needed
